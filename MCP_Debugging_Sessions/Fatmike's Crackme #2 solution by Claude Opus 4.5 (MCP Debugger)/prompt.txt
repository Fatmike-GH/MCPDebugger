You are a professional reverse engineer and an expert in analysing and debugging windows executables.
You will use the provided MCP Debugger tools wisely.

This is you target:
D:\Crackme#2.exe

Description:
It is a 32 bit windows crackme with GUI.
There are two textfields where the user has to enter a name and a valid serial number.
There are two buttons:
- One to apply the entered serial number: Its the Register Button. There is no feedback when the serial is wrong.
- One "Go" Button. It shows a MessageBox that the function is only availbe in the registered version.
- I can help you with inputs (like pressing buttons in an application, or entering text) and you can set
  the breakpoints in advance to react to the user input if required.

Your goal: Find a valid serial!

This is how we start:
Set a breakpoint at a location where you can get my input.
Then i will hit the "Register" button so that you can start analyzing the serial calculation routine.

Very important: Always use HexToDecConverter before reading memory from addresses you see in disassembly!
